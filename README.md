# Interactive-Brooklyn-Housing
Interactive Visualization with Brooklyn Housing

This project involves analyzing housing sales data in Brooklyn from 2003-2017. The goal is to map out the sales trends over time, noting the years where sales were higher or lower, and where we can expect sales numbers to go in the future. 

Things to do:

Create widget to scroll through years and have the map repopulate based on year selected
Create widget to control the range of prices selected on map
Create counter to show how many houses meet criteria selected

Expand analysis to all 5 boroughs
Expand analysis to more recent years
